# CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the CI/CD workflows implemented for the TABFRET project.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **CI Build & Test Workflow** (`ci.yml`)

A comprehensive continuous integration workflow that:

- **Triggers on:**
  - Push to `main` or `master` branches
  - Pull requests to `main` or `master` branches
  - Manual workflow dispatch

- **Build Process:**
  - Runs on Windows (windows-latest) - required for WPF applications
  - Uses .NET 6.0 SDK
  - Restores all NuGet dependencies
  - Builds the entire solution in Release configuration
  - Runs all unit tests
  - Publishes the application with all dependencies

- **Artifacts:**
  - **Build Artifacts** (all commits):
    - Name: `TABFRET-build-{commit-sha}`
    - Retention: 30 days
    - Contains the full published application
  
  - **Release Package** (main/master only):
    - Name: `TABFRET-Release-{commit-sha}`
    - Retention: 90 days
    - ZIP file ready for distribution

### 2. **Release Workflow** (`release.yml`)

An automated release workflow that:

- **Triggers on:**
  - Version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`)
  - Manual workflow dispatch

- **Release Process:**
  - Builds and tests the application
  - Creates a ZIP package named `TABFRET-{version}.zip`
  - Automatically creates a GitHub Release with:
    - The version tag as the release name
    - The ZIP artifact attached as a downloadable asset
    - Auto-generated release notes from commits

### 3. **Documentation**

- **Workflow Documentation** (`.github/workflows/README.md`):
  - Detailed explanation of each workflow
  - Instructions for downloading artifacts
  - Guide for creating releases
  - Local testing instructions

- **Main README Updates**:
  - Added CI/CD status badges
  - Updated .NET version requirements
  - Added CI/CD documentation links
  - Improved build from source instructions

## Changes Made

### Removed
- `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` (duplicate of ci.yml)

### Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete rewrite with enhanced features
- `README.md` - Added badges and CI/CD documentation

### Added
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - New automated release workflow
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Comprehensive CI/CD documentation

## Key Features

1. **Automated Building:** Every push and PR is automatically built and tested
2. **Artifact Generation:** Build artifacts are automatically created and stored
3. **Release Automation:** Tagging a version automatically creates a GitHub Release
4. **Quality Assurance:** Tests run on every build to ensure code quality
5. **Manual Triggers:** Both workflows can be manually triggered when needed

## Usage

### For Developers
- Push code to trigger CI builds
- All artifacts are available in the Actions tab
- Tests run automatically on every PR

### For Releases
1. Update version in code (if applicable)
2. Commit changes
3. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
4. The release is automatically created with downloadable artifacts

## Benefits

- ✅ Consistent build process across all environments
- ✅ Automated testing ensures code quality
- ✅ Easy access to build artifacts for testing
- ✅ Streamlined release process
- ✅ Automated release notes generation
- ✅ Version-tagged releases with downloadable packages

## Technical Details

- **Platform:** Windows (required for WPF)
- **SDK:** .NET 6.0
- **Build Configuration:** Release
- **Package Format:** ZIP
- **Artifact Storage:** GitHub Actions artifacts and GitHub Releases
