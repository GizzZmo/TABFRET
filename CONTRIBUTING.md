4. Use Test Explorer to run unit tests

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues reported in the issue tracker
- **New features**: Add new functionality to the application
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance improvements**: Optimize existing code
- **UI/UX improvements**: Enhance the user interface and experience

### Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, etc.

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   - Run existing tests: `dotnet test`
   - Add new tests for new functionality
   - Test the application manually

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ```
   
   Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Keep the first line under 50 characters
   - Add details in the body if needed

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Coding Standards

### C# Style Guidelines

- Follow [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small (Single Responsibility Principle)

### MVVM Pattern

TABFRET uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:

- **Models**: Data structures and business entities
- **Views**: XAML files for UI
- **ViewModels**: UI logic and data preparation
- **Services**: Business logic and external interactions

### Code Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/          # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ Views/           # XAML views
â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels/      # ViewModels for MVVM
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/        # Business logic services
â”œâ”€â”€ Utils/           # Helper utilities
â””â”€â”€ Config/          # Configuration files
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use dependency injection** where appropriate
2. **Implement INotifyPropertyChanged** in ViewModels
3. **Keep Views thin** - logic belongs in ViewModels
4. **Write unit tests** for business logic
5. **Handle exceptions** appropriately
6. **Use async/await** for I/O operations

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if needed (README, code comments, etc.)
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass** locally
4. **Update the CHANGELOG** (if we have one) with your changes
5. **Request a review** from maintainers
6. **Address review comments** promptly
7. **Squash commits** if requested before merging
